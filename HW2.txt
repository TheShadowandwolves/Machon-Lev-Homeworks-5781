Q1.

.text
first:
lb $a0 5
add $t1 $a0 $zero
syscall

lb Sa0 5
add §t2 $a0 $zero
syscall


la $s0 $t1
la $s2 $t2
bne $s0 $s1, equal
j notEqual

equal:
add $s1 $s0 $zero
la $a0 1 
syscall
j Exit

notEqual:
j first

Exit:

Q2.
$t2 = 1
than $t2 is not equal to $s0
jumps to ELSE
$t2 = $t2 + 2
Done:
Result $t2 = 0x00101010

Q3.

yes it is possible to jump instruction for pc to be adress of something else.
But branch-on-equal will not instruct/set the pc to the same adress. 
Bne will check if adress/value is same as other adress/value and than implement pc to this adress.

Q4.

1.
since loop is a constant (label), rpt would be an I-type instruction.
2.
loop:
slti $t1, §t2, 1
beq $t1, 1, Exit
addi $t2, -1
j loop
Exit:
